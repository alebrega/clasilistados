* Twitter.class.php (Twitter->update):
o Added more error checking:
	o Check if data sending fails *or* if not all data was sent
	o Check for errors while reading data
	o Check for HTTP errors (for example a Twitter 500 Internal Server Error is now caught)
o Data is now actually POSTed, not GETed.

* Twitter.class.php4: Added this file which works on PHP4 (thanks Francois Tornier
for testing this)
